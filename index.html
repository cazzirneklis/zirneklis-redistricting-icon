 <h1> 2021 Timeline: Redistricting in New York</h1>
    
<p> By: Christine Zirneklis </p>  

<p> Every ten years, new lines are drawn for the congressional districts after the census, to reflect changes in population. This process, called redistricting, is important because lines can be drawn in lots of ways, and if drawn unfairly it can leave out certain communities, or give an unfair advantage to groups or individuals. </p>

<p> This year, New York has a new bipartisan commission which is in charge of this process. Voters approved this change in 2014 via an amendment to the state constitution, and according to the commission, their goal is to “reform the redistricting process to introduce greater independence, and guarantee the application of substantive criteria that protect minority voting rights, communities of interest, and rational line-drawing.” </p>
 
<p>New lines are even more important this year, since New York lost one congressional seat due to a decline in the population that was counted in the census. Because of COVID and other delays in 2020, this year the process is also on an extra-tight timeline. So: how does this process work? </p>

  <div> <p> <b>Mid-January 2022</b>: At least seven of the 10 commission members — including one member appointed by each of the four legislative majority and minority leaders — have to agree on the full set of proposed lines before the process can move to the next step: sending the draft maps to the state Legislature.  </p> </div>

<div><p> <b>Late February 2022</b>: The Legislature needs to approve new lines with a two-thirds vote in the Assembly and the Senate.  The Assembly and Senate can also reject the work of the Independent Redistricting Commission and draw districts on their own.</p> </div>

<div><p> <b>A twist</b>: in the November 2 New York general election, on the ballot is another constitutional amendment moving up the deadlines for redistricting, moving up the commission submission deadline from Jan. 15, 2022 to Jan. 1, 2022, and an additional plan to be sent to the Legislature by Jan 15, instead of late February. This means the timeline <i>could</i> be even shorter, putting even more pressure on this important decision-making process. </p></div>
